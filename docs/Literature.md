## Buses Extra 

**49 October-November 1987**

I'd been looking for this magazine for a very long time then at last I found a copy on E-bay for a very reasonable £2.50 plus postage and packing.

Over fourteen pages David Kaye gives an exhaustive account of the fifty or so Freighter chassis that were fitted with bus type bodies. He gives an account of all the undertakings that employed SD Freighters and reports on their use when they were sold on.

The article also features the low entry bus chassis from the SPV Division that appeared at the 1980 motor show. Subsequently it was bodied by Reeve Burgess with a centre entrance either side. At first used at Gatwick Airport as a car park bus by 1983 it had been reallocated to Heathrow for internal staff transport. Regrettably no further orders 
followed.

For anyone interested in this aspect of the history of Shelvoke &amp; Drewry this article is a &nbsp;mine of information. So I hope you have as successful a search as I have.

## The London Brick Company

Bill Aldridge.

Not only does Bill give a fascinating account of brick production but he also tells the story of handling and transporting the London Brick Company's products. Shelvoke's Freightlifter and Defiant forklift trucks feature in the story. So too do the Refuse Vehicles as the brick pits were used for landfill and L.B.C. became engaged in the waste disposal business. A thoroughly recommended read.

## An Anthology of The Worthing Tramocars

The Southdown Enthusiasts' Club.

This book was published in 2002 by The Southdown Enthusiasts' Club. It tells the fascinating story of how, soon after the formation of Shelvoke &amp; Drewry, W.R. Gates recognised the potential of the chassis as a passenger vehicle. The low entrance height made the Freighter suitable for sea front operations in Worthing. Gates gave his vehicle the name 'Tramocar', and built up to a fleet of eleven, before selling out to Southdown in 1938.

The book contains 92 pages of text, with 12 black &amp; white photographs with colour card covers.

One section is a reproduction of an article from the November 1st 1924 edition of 'Modern Transport' in which the new S &amp; D Freighter is described. Time Tables and Fare Tables are reproduced, and a full account of the Tramocar operation is given.

Anyone with an interest in S &amp; D will find a fascinating insight into a more unusual role for the Freighter within the pages of this book.

## From bicycles to dustcarts &#8230; and lots more.
      
James Sydney Drewry (1882 &#8211; 1952)<br>
Malcolm Stewart Easton.<br>
Published 2022.
      
Malcolm Easton, the grandson of James Drewry, has used his grandfather's extensive archive and other material to write a comprehensive history of the life and achievements of James Drewry. All too often the contribution of James Drewry to the S&amp;D Partnership is overshadowed by memories of Harry Shelvoke. This excellent book redresses the balance and gives an insight into the character and achievements of the co-founder of Shelvoke &amp; Drewry.
      
Clearly James Drewry kept many documents relating to his career as a distinguished designer and engineer. Tony Drewry, who is Malcolm Easton's, second cousin, has also researched the family history over many years and produced an extensive website with the assistance of Malcolm in his task. See:- <a href="http://www.drewry.net/TreeMill/indiI066.html" target="_blank">http://www.drewry.net/TreeMill/indiI066.html</a>
      
The book is A5 format and 118 pages long and extensively illustrated. The purchase price is £8.00 plus £2.40 post &amp; packing where appropriate. The Editor can supply a contact address.

In 2010 Malcolm Bates, former SD employee, where he managed the sales publicity, was commissioned to write a series of articles about Municipal vehicles for Vintage Roadscene Magazine. Naturally Shelvoke &amp; Drewry products featured prominently in these articles.

{: .table .table-striped}
| Issue | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Issue 123 February 2010 | In the first of these articles Malcolm looked at the early days of the SD Freighter and showed examples of the ['W' Type]({{site.baseurl}}{% link VW.md %}) with a moving floor&nbsp;type body and the Fore &amp; Aft tipper. |
| Issue 124 &nbsp;March 2010 |In the 1960's compaction type bodies were introduced such as S&amp;D's Pakamatic and Revopak and the Eagle Compressmore. |
| Issue 125 April 2010 |For this issue Malcolm turned his attention to the effect of 'competitive tendering' under the Margaret Thatcher led Conservative government.&nbsp;Also in this issue Ron Henderson wrote about S&amp;D's SPV fire appliances. |
| Issue 126 May 2010 |The growth of commercial waste companies was the theme for this issue. |
| Issue 127 June 2010 |Standard commercial vehicles used by municipal operators were featured in this month's article. |
| Issue 128 July 2010 |Liquid waste collection utilising gully emptiers and cesspool emptiers occupied Malcolm's mind for this issue. |
| Issue 129 August 2010 |Roadsweepers were this month's subject. Appropriately in a separate feature a Drewry designed Lacre roadsweeper is&nbsp; shown on the 1970 HCVS London to Brighton Run. |
| Issue 130 September 2010 |The bulk loaders that deliver waste to the landfill sites are the subject of Malcolm's article for this issue. We've come a long way&nbsp; from the time the local dustcart used to take each load to the tip giving the operators a welcome break. |
| Issue 131 October 2010 |Prototypes that never made the market are the subject of this article. Included are photos of SD's ill fated Model 25/30 Fore &amp;&nbsp; Aft tipper which failed spectacularly.&nbsp; Sketches of Malcolm's ideas for future SD products give a glimpse of what might have been. The less than successful Freighter&nbsp; New Type also features. |
| Issue 132 November 2010 | How did all those foreign designs take over the British market? In his inimitable style Malcolm recalls how Heil got a foothold in the U.K.,&nbsp;and others such as Norba followed.<br.>He laments that even Dennis are now Spanish owned. It's a long way from the time when SD exported world-wide. |

| Issue | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Issue 147 February 2012 | Whilst writing about Guy vehicles Malcolm Bates managed to sneak&nbsp;in a picture of a Defiant 26 fork lift truck loading a Guy Warrior truck.|
| Issue149 April 2012 | in a series entitled 'Top 10 Life Changing Commercials', Malcolm turned his attention to S&amp;D once more, principally featuring the Special Purpose Vehicle Division. |
| Issue 168 November 2013 | Malcolm Bates visits McCreath Taylor in Lisburn, Northern Ireland and drives the newly restored ['W' Type]({{site.baseurl}}{% link VW.md %}) Fore &amp; Aft tipper. The 'W' features on the front cover.|
| Issue 170 January 2014 |  Once again a Shelvoke graces the front cover. This time it's a Defiant fork lift truck loading a London Brick Company's AEC with bricks.<br> Inside over eight pages Malcolm Bates relates the story of the early days of mechanical handling. And as we'd expect the article mainly focuses on SD's Freightlifter and Defiant fork lift trucks.&nbsp;<br> Also on the letters page there are two photos of an unusual water tanker on a ['T' Type]({{site.baseurl}}{% link VT.md %}) chassis.|
| Issue 172 (171?) February 2014 | Under the Title 'Binwagon History BC' Malcolm Bates writes about refuse collection before compaction and features the introduction of SD's Fore &amp; Aft tipper.

| Issue 173 April  2014 | In Part 3 of 'The History of the Bin Wagon' Malcolm Bates relates how the SD Revopak was designed in response to the  changing nature of refuse In particular the adoption of plastic  refuse sacks had demonstrated some of the limitations of the Pakamatic design.  The Revopaks rotating tines made short work of plastic sacks as it did of  discarded fridges, wardrobes etc.  With his exhaustive knowledge of Shelvoke &amp; Drewry Malcolm relates how as local authorities realised the advantages of wheelie bins the dominance of foreign manufacturers of bin lifts benefitted foreign manufacturers of complete refuse collection vehicles also.  The era of British manufacture of specialised RCV's was almost at an end.|
| Issue174 May 2014  | Malcolm Bates came to S&amp;D in 1969 having been appointed publicity officer in the Sales Department by Jack Wilkinson, where he was responsible for designing&nbsp;and producing all the sales brochures, arranging the photographs and producing cutaway drawings&nbsp; for the Drawing Office.That he succeeded at interview was something of a minor miracle. Arriving in as red three piece suit he parked&nbsp;his&nbsp; MG ZB Magnette in the space reserved for the Finance Director; he then said he thought&nbsp;SD sales and service literature was &#8220;awful&#8221;&nbsp;only&nbsp; to learn that Jack Wilkinson's brother produced them for S&amp;D as manager at the printers Spotiswood and Ballantyne.&nbsp; The sombre grey suited management of S&amp;D found the young graphic designer had very different ideas from their own.<br>A fine series of articles has kept the SD name alive to readers of this magazine. |
| Issue 180<br> November 2014 | In this article Malcolm Bates reports on the SD vehicles supplied for non-refuse collection duties. Throughout its history S&amp;D attracted customers requiring a rugged chassis and often the ability to provide a narrow body. |
