# Paul Williamson's Model of a ['W' Type]({{site.baseurl}}{% link VW.md %}) F &amp; A Tipper

I received this photograph of a model ['W' Type]({{site.baseurl}}{% link VW.md %}) Fore &amp; Aft tipper with a bulk refuse hopper. <b>Paul Williamson, </b>who made, it writes: I made it some years ago, Birmingham Corporation were phasing out their old green livery and as a "Brummie" it was my way of preserving a little piece of history.
The model is scratchbuilt to OO (1/76) scale using plasticard except for the white metal wheels which are from a kit.

A truly magnificent model.

The Dualdrive could be driven like a normal truck between sites at 22 m.p.h. and then controlled from a separate cabin. It was developed after the magistrates, at Slough, convicted British Railways for using a vehicle on the road in which the driver's vision was obscured by a 'jungle of steel'. This example could lift 18,000 lbs and carries special container lifting equipment.


# Why Make These Models?

I was occasionally asked to speak to groups of people:- Pensioners' Groups etc., and the history of Refuse Collection seemed to be a sensible choice.

When I had more time in retirement I thought it worth trying to make a model of an early Freighter for a forthcoming talk. 

Using mostly plastic card and sections I was moderately pleased with the result. 

A horse driven refuse cart was the next project.

Then utilising parts from a commercial plastic kit the Fork Lift truck was made, and with surplus parts the F. &amp; A. Tipper was made.

Wanting a vehicle with a single cab the next project was the Brewer's truck. 

Finally the Dual-Drive version of the Freightlifter Forklift Truck was produced.
