<div>Tony Cauchi sent in this photo
of an SD which he'd seen parked for a while without registration or
name so he doesn't know what's the story but he's learnt that some
contacts from UK had been asked if they would like to buy it! From the
photo it looks well looked after. Further it is understood that an 'N'
type has been returned to the U.K. from Malta and we hope to be able to
report on this remarkable occurrence in the future.

Meanwhile as we go to
press two SD's are advertised for sale in Malta on Ebay a 1982 revopak
and a 1984 Maxipak.

We were sorry to learn
that the Stondon Motor Museum has had to close because visitor numbers
were in- sufficient to sustain the enterprise. Brightwells Classic
Vehicles auctioned the entire collection on Wednesday 10th June. The
1920 Lacre roadsweeper designed by James Drewry was sold for £5,200
whilst the Bedford/Lacre realised £4,600, James Drewry was also
involved in the design of this roadsweeper following his departure from
Shelvoke &amp; Drewry.
