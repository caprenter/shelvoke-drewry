# The Freighter

The Freighter was the original Shelvoke &amp; Drewry design with its small solid rubber tyred wheels, tiller steering and tiller controlled gearbox. In production from 1922 until the very last vehicle was built for St. Helens in 1955, although after 1952 the few Freighters produced were mostly for industrial puposes. Pneumatic tyres became standard after 1931. From 1945 production continued as the Mk II . The following&nbsp;are known to exist.

## No. Reg. No.(1)

* SD Freighter
* Year of Manufacture: 1925
* Original Owner: WH Allen, Bedford. 
* Owner: Present Owner unknown. 
* Location: Bedfordshire

This Freighter was produced for WH Allen Sons &amp; Co. of Bedford , manufacturers of marine and aero engines in 1925 who also operated a standard SD Freighter at this time. Modified to carry an amazing ten ton load the altered gear ratios restricted the Freighter to just 3 m.p.h. The front wheels were built up with wooden felloes and steel tyres whilst the oversize rear wheels were steel castings. The Freighter returned to Letchworth in the mid 1970's for retirement. A worthy working life of some 50 years.

The photo was sent in by Kim Syder the daughter of Jack Arnold who was a very popular Service Manager for S&amp;D and shows the return of the Freighter to S &amp; D. Jack is on the right in the photo.

How it came to a barn in Bedfordshire has yet to be discovered. But this is a truly historic part of the SD Freighter story.

This Freighter was discovered in a scrapyard and restored by a team under the instructions of Maurice McGregor. It was last taxed in 1937 and is believed to have done little work as the solid tyres were unsuitable for dirt roads. The restoration was completed in 2017 and the vehicle placed in the Museum.

</figure>

No less than fourteen further ['N' Type]({% link VN.md %})s were operating in Malta when Jaap Mikkers visited in April 2003.

These all carried S&amp;D's Revopak body. It is believed that by the end of 2015 all these vehicles have been withdrawn from service due&nbsp;&nbsp;to more stringent Maltese Government regulations.


## GJD 121 N
A 1974 'NN' tanker was built for delivering domestic heating oil in London for BP Ltd. With its narrow width and short wheelbase it was ideal for use in narrow streets.It was last seen as a cab/chassis for sale by Westbury Breakers, Wiltshire.

In Malta it was operated by a private contractor.

# The ['P' Type]({% link VP.md %})
What was to prove to be Shelvoke &amp; Drewry's last model, the ['P' Type]({% link VP.md %}) made its appearance in1978. Designed under a team headed by Tom Tillson, with Frank Dean as Chief Engineer the 'P' series tilt cab was once more built 'in house.' The 'P' series chassis ranged from 11.5 tons gvw up to a tandem axled 22 tons gvw. Nine examples are in existence, with possibly a few more on Malta. (At least 10 'P' series vehicles were still in operation in Malta in 2003. It is believed that by the end of 2015 all these vehicles have been withdrawn from service due to more stringent Maltese Government regulations.)

This vehicle was among the very last SD's built. After service with Omagh District Council it was sold at auction in September 1988 and eventually acquired by James McAleer of Fintona, Co. Tyrone who converted it to a recovery vehicle for commercial vehicles. This included removing the rear bogie, the automatic gearbox was replaced by a manual box and a new rear axle was fitted. After many years the vehicle was bought by Peter Johnston in July 2010 and fitted with a beavertail body so that it can be used to transport preserved vehicles, and is shown left with <b>GJD 121 N</b>. At that time the vehicle had recorded just 35,000 miles.

# Fork Lift Trucks

Because of import restrictions the London Brick Company were unable to purchase Hyster Heavy Duty Fork Lift Trucks in the 1950's. An approach to S&amp;D was made and the Company commenced the manufacture of the Freighlifter range in 1952. This range continued in production until 1962 when the new Defiants were introduced. Fork Lift Truck production ceased in 1974 when this part of the business was sold to Rubery Owen who manufactured the Conveyancer Fork Lift Truck range.

## SD Freightlifter Fork Lift Trucks still in Service

Wayne Abbott from Sheffield operates a 1957 S&amp;D Freighlifter 18/82 and says there are a further five Freightlifter trucks in the Sheffield area. We are aware also of two trucks still in service in Belgium.

## South Yorkshire

A 1971 SD Defiant fork lift truck is still operational in a timber yard in South Yorkshire.

The truck n 2005 when a local contractor had no further use for it. There is every indication that the truck was stored outdoors for a number of years. In later years the Freightlifter was used for lifting military tanks on and off transport using long fork extensions which the museum also obtained.

I would highly recommend a visit For directions see <a href="http://nationalforktruckheritagecentre.org/" target="_blank">http://nationalforktruckheritagecentre.org/</a> and note that a prior telephone call is advisable. The museum is reached via the Butterley station on the preserved Midland Railway.


# The SPV Division - Fire Appliances

When S&amp;D ceased Fork Lift Truck production in 1974 the SPV Division was formed. In 1975 Shelvokes entered the Fire Service and Crash Tender market, in collaboration with companies such as Carmichael and Cheshire Fire Engineering.

## ETN 909 W

New to Tyne &amp; Wear as a foam tender, stationed at Whitley Bay Fire Station. In the late 1990's the Brigade moved away from dedicated foam tenders to Operational Support Tenders, which were multi-purpose. EBB 847 W was converted at this time. Its owner now uses it to transport his 1921 Dennis ['N' Type]({% link VN.md %}) to rallies etc.&nbsp; See:- <a href="http://www.dennisfire.co.uk/P13.htm" target="_blank">http://www.dennisfire.co.uk/P13.htm</a>

**Don't be alarmed if using this link! The two Shelvokes share a home with a host of Dennis' appliances.**

## RAB 498 P

When Spencer Townson of [West Yorkshire Classics](http://www.westyorkshireclassics.co.uk) of Bradford added <b>RAB 498 P</b> to his fleet of classic vehicles he didn't realise how rare a Shelvoke he had purchased. This 1976 S&amp;D/Carmichael Fire Tender is one of only a handful that were ever made.

Originally in the service of Hereford and Worcester Fire Brigade, the vehicle spent its last years at Yorkshire's Eggborough Power Station. It had only just over 19,000 miles on the clock, when Spencer acquired it.

It then moved to the Santa Pod Raceway in Northamptonshire, and is now at the Museum of RAF Fire Fighting at Scunthorpe.

# LATIL

From November 1932 until production was transferred to the London based concessionaires in 1937, S &amp; D produced between 150 and 175 of the French Latil KTL tractors.

Four Latil tractors are known to be preserved: 

Latil 4 x 4 built 1938 Reg. No. <b>BMO 154,</b> and <b>OSU 375 </b>whose date of production is unknown. 

<b>KEX 901 </b>was built in 1937 by Latil at Fulham. It was restored in the 1980's by George Berry and is now owned by his brother Peter. The vehicle is in show condition and will appear in rallies in the 2006 season. 

<b>JD 8350</b> which is on display at the British Commercial Vehicle Museum, Leyland, Lancashire, is a 1937 model built by S&amp;D and carries the livery of Tate &amp; Lyle.

# Lacre

I am grateful to Mr Steven Thomas for sending information about a 1920 Lacre Roadsweeper that was at the Stondon Transport Museum near Henlow, Beds.

<figure class="figure w-100 text-center">
  <img src="/assets/Images2/Lacre.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Lacre">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Photo: Peter Jarman</figcaption>
</figure>

What has this to do with S&amp;D? The Sweeper was designed by James Drewry in 1912 and built whilst he and Harry Shelvoke were employed by the Lacre Company.

The vehicle was used by Motherwell and Wishaw Council in Scotland until 1952. The Registration Number is <b>800 WJH </b>and the Sweeper has taken part in the HCVS London to Brighton Run winning many 'Concours d'Elegance' over the years.

The Stondon Musem closed in 2015 and on 10th June 2015 the sweeper was sold at auction. It's present owner and location are unknown.
