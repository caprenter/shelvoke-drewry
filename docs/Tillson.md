# Thomas William Tillson, A.M.I.Mech.E
<b>By Stan Quin.</b>
<p>Thomas William Tillson, ("Tom") was born in Coventry in 1908 and served an apprenticeship with the Daimler motor car company. Tom received his technical education at the Coventry Technical College where he gained the City and Guilds of London Institute silver medal.</p>
<p>On completion of his apprenticeship, he left the Engineering Drawing Office of Daimler to join Dennis Brothers of Guildford in 1932, as an engineering draughtsman and then designer. He remained with them for 27 years and acted as Chief Engineer during the latter eight years with that Company. He travelled extensively in the Middlle East, the Continent and the USA, studying the application and potential of heavy and special purpose vehicles, as well as visiting the plants of similar manufacturers in those countries.</p>
<p>An Associate Member of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, he was also a former member of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, standards and technical board. </p>

<p>Earlier in his career he had eight years teaching
experience as a visiting lecturer in engineering subjects up to higher
national certificate standard.</p>
<p>He was well known throughout the heavy vehicle
industry and when he was invited to join Shelvoke &amp; Drewry as Chief
Engineer in 1959, he had for many years, already been closely connected
with the design of municipal cleansing vehicles. There was no doubt
that Dennis Brothers' loss was S&amp;D's gain.</p>
<p>Tom's arrival, following the departure of his
predecessor John Huggins, coincided with a period in S&amp;D's history
when morale was at a low level. He brought with him a breath of much
needed fresh air that swept through the Company so rapidly that he was
immediately established in his new surroundings with the full support
of his new colleagues. His enthusiasm was infectious and this injected
a sense of urgency into every project that was undertaken. Despite
Tom's wealth of knowledge, he encouraged others at all levels to
advance their own ideas to promote an atmosphere of involvement,
believing that people perform better when their opinions are respected
rather than when they operate in a climate of doubt and inferiority. </p>
<p>Woe betide anyone however, who dared to suggest
that something could not be done or could not be done within a certain
time scale. "Can't" was a remark that did not exist in Tom's vocabulary
and if anyone inadvertently used the expression, it would be taken as a
challenge to demonstrate otherwise. He seldom failed! </p>
<p>The immediate task awaiting him at S&amp;D was to
design the "T" series of chassis, exploiting changes in legislation
which permitted increased axle and vehicle loading limits. Coincident
with the development of the "T" series chassis was the design of
Pakamatic bodies incorporating compression type, continuous loading
compaction systems. These new models won instant acclaim and Tom's
reputation was such that many of his previous Dennis customers switched
to the "T" range of Pakamatics and the order book reflected a
significant increase in S&amp;D's market share.</p>
<p>Tom Tillson's initial contribution was without
doubt an important factor in what was the first phase of the Company's
expansion programme involving the acquisition of No.2 Factory in
Letchworth to accommodate additional production facilities. He was
deservedly rewarded in 1961 with an invitation to join the Board as
Technical Director </p>
<p>The manner in which he successfully dealt with
the development of the "T" series Pakamatic projects was typical of his
commitment in dealing with many other formidable tasks which awaited
him. These were to include the design and development of a
comprehensive range of "Defiant" fork lift trucks as well as an endless
assortment of Special Purpose Vehicles including fire vehicle chassis
for water tenders and air-crash tenders.</p>
<p>In considering the catalogue of Tom's many
achievements it has to be said that the most successful project of all
was the design and development of the "N" series chassis incorporating
the revolutionary Revopak body equipment which was more effective as a
compaction vehicle than the Pakamatic First deliveries of Revopak
vehicles were made in 1971 and they became so popular that in addition
to exports, S&amp;D's share of the UK municipal market increased from
30% to more than 60%. The overall effect was that annual turnover
increased from £3 million to £25 million within a period of 10 years
prior to 1979.</p>

<p>Tom eventually retired in 1979 having completed a
remarkable career which included 20 years valuable service with
S&amp;D. During that time he won the highest esteem from all who were
privileged to work with him and enjoyed his great sense of humour
Needless to say, he was sadly missed by his many friends following a
well earned retirement.</p>
<p>Sadly Tom died in 1982 following a period of
illness which began within a year of his retirement and his death was
followed by that of his widow Rene who passed away in 1988. They are
survived by their two married daughters Maureen and Janet and five
grandchildren by Maureen's marriage.</p>

## Tom Tillson - A Personal Memory
<p>When Tom Tillson arrived at S&amp;D in 1959 I was
working as a Jig &amp; Tool draughtsman. We were located at the far end
of the main Drawing Office. As the design of the 'T' range of vehicles
proceeded Tom was a frequent visitor to this part of the manufacturing
process. He would arrive, pipe in hand, to discuss how a component
might best be designed for manufacture. His un-stuffy approach
immediately won him respect.</p>
<p>At Christmas one of the ladies in the Drawing
Office had knitted a matchbox cover for him, for Tom appeared to gain
inspiration from his pipe smoking. Not to be outdone the Jig &amp; Tool
Department had a large parcel delivered to Tom's home. Mrs. Tillson
staggered into the house with the heavy parcel. When Tom arrived home
and unwrapped the gift he found a large log! Included in the parcel
were instructions for a 'do it yourself' match making kit.</p>
<p>Eventually, I believe, Mrs. Tillson saw the funny
side of this episode. But it demonstrated how readily Tom fitted in to
his new surroundings at S&amp;D.</p>
