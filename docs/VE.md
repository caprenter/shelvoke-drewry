# The New Or 'E' Type 1937 - 1939.

It was not until 1937 that it was deemed necessary to introduce a new design to be manufactured alongside the SD Freighter.

## 1937 The New or 'E' type.

In 1937 the New type or E type appeared. One of these vehicles is shown above at an exhibition equipped with a moving floor body. The engine was now placed in front of the driver. A conventional steering wheel was provided on later versions, but a tiller still controlled the gear changing. Electric starting was now standard. I don't believe many New Types were manufactured and no more were produced after World War II.
