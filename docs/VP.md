# The 'P' Type 1978 &#8211; 1991

For the replacement for the ['N' Type]({% link VN.md %}) S&amp;D revertedto an all steel cab manufactured in their own works.

## 1978 The 'P' type Revopak

For the 'P' series the all steel tilt cab was designed by Ogle design of Letchworth and Dennis used a similar design also by Ogle. The cab components could be produced using a press brake and tooling costs were around Â£10,000 compared to the millions required for a conventional pressed steel cab.

## 1978 The 'P' type Intapak

## 1978 The 'P' type Maxipak


Unlike the Revopak, which was a continuous loader, the Maxipak was an intermittent loader. The mechanism was more complicated than the Revopak's as it utilised a sweeper blade and a packer blade which were both hydraulically operated. The distinctive hopper is deeper than that of the Revopak and the support structure is evident as the hydraulic cylinders are inside the body so that side cover panels were not required. Technical details of the Maxipak can be found on the <a href="Tech.html" target="_blank">Technical Page. </a>

## 1983 Redesign of the body

A squared off version of the body was introduced in 1983 and later an all steel body. Shelvoke &amp; Drewry was now owned by Krug International's Dempster Division hence the vehicles were given the title Shelvoke Dempster.
